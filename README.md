To enable X-Ray subsegment creation for GraphQL resolvers, add this package as a dependency of your project and use
code like this:

```javascript
const traceResolvers = require('@lifeomic/graphql-resolvers-xray-tracing');
const schema = makeExecutableSchema( ... );
traceResolvers(schema);
```

After enabling X-Ray tracing, you should see new subsegments in your X-Ray traces like this:
